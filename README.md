# EDA-of-brain-tumor-data

In this project, we aim to conduct an exploratory data analysis of a collection of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans. The primary objective is to gain insights into the MRI data and uncover patterns that may be relevant for medical research or diagnosis. MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique widely used in the medical field to visualize internal structures of the body, making it essential to understand the characteristics and potential findings within the data.
