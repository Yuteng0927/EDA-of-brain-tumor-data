# EDA-of-brain-tumor-data

In this project, we aim to conduct an exploratory data analysis of a collection of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans. The primary objective is to gain insights into the MRI data and uncover patterns that may be relevant for medical research or diagnosis. MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique widely used in the medical field to visualize internal structures of the body, making it essential to understand the characteristics and potential findings within the data.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the authors and contributors of the original Kaggle project titled "Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning for RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification" for providing the foundation and inspiration for this work. Their efforts in creating the dataset and developing the initial analysis were instrumental in shaping the direction of this project.
